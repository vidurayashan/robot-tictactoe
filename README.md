## Introduction

Robot Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent. The AI uses a basic algorithm to decide its moves, providing a challenging experience for human players. This project aims to demonstrate the application of game theory and basic AI in a straightforward and engaging way.

## Features

- Play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI opponent.
- Simple and intuitive command-line interface.
- Demonstrates fundamental AI concepts.
- Easy to understand and modify.

## Installation

To get started with Robot Tic-Tac-Toe, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vidurayashan/robot-tictactoe.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```sh
    cd robot-tictactoe
3. **Install the required dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage

To start the game run the notebook code.ipynb. 

**Game Instructions**
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. You are 'X' and the AI is 'O'.
3. Players take turns placing their marks in empty squares.
4. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
